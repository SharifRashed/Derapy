                    Sometimes I wonder what my parents were like when they were my age. I would love to know what they liked, who their friends were, and what they were going through.When I am older, not only will I be able to look back on these episdoes and reminisce, I'll be able to share these stories with kids of my own. They can discover how I came to be engaged, how I navigated the pandemic, how I felt about government and media, what movies and music I liked, and all the crazy people I met driving for Lyft. I hope those very same people and you enjoy!
