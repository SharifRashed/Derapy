# Welcome to Derapy 

## Primary Features- The primary features of the app allows a user to create an account and log-in to the website where they can be directed to create a podcast suggestion to help Derapy become a better podcast. 

### Target Audience- The intended audience are Derapy listeners but all podcast listeners were kept in mind while designing the website.

### Getting Started-

`npm test` 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\ See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. 

### Purpose 

What problem does the website solve?

As the Official website of Derapy, the app aims to make the podcast even better by allowing users to add their input and opinions.

### Contributions

Deryk Buxton gave me the materials I needed to complete the project, the logo, any pictures I might need, text about himself and the podcast, etc.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
